🏏 Cricket Shot Analysis with K-Means Clustering

A machine learning project applying K-Means clustering to cricket data to uncover batting patterns based on shot placement, pitch conditions, and bowler characteristics.

📊 Overview

Groups batting scenarios using unsupervised learning

Identifies patterns in shot selection and run scoring

Analyzes impact of pitch position and bowler type

Visualizes player behavior across clusters

🏏 Dataset Features

shot_quadrant – Field area of the shot

pitch_quadrant – Pitch location

bowler_hand – Left/Right handed bowler

bowler_type – Fast/Spin bowler

shot_type – Encoded shot category

runs – Runs scored

🔧 Tech Stack

Python, pandas, numpy

scikit-learn (K-Means, preprocessing)

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

📈 Results

6 distinct clusters discovered

Clear separation of aggressive vs defensive batting strategies

Insights into shot selection, pitch usage, and bowler matchups

🔮 Future Work

Add contextual features (weather, ground conditions)
